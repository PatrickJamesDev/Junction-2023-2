# Junction-2023-Huawei

## Overview

Many people in Western countries suffer from "Tech-neck," a condition caused by habits such as bending the neck down and rounding the shoulders when using smartphones. This bad habit is often challenging to be mindful of, as its effects, such as sore neck, shoulders, and back, may only become apparent hours or days later.

The **Junction-2023-Huawei** project addresses this issue by creating a website that sends notifications when users exhibit poor posture for an extended period. The website achieves this by tracking the user's face and the angle at which the phone is held. Ideally, the service would run in the background, sending global notifications to prompt users to correct their posture.

## Requirements

To use the **Junction-2023-Huawei** website, users need the following:

- Most modern browsers that support JavaScript.
- HTTPS support (enabled by default for most users).
- Gyro-sensor (the website is designed for phones).

## Not Implemented Features

Due to time constraints during development, the following features were not implemented but were considered for future enhancements:

- **Android App:** A dedicated Android application for a more seamless experience.
- **Eye Tracking:** To reduce false positives of bad posture.
- **Statistics:** Tracking long-term improvements in posture.
- **User Customization:** Ability for users to customize countdown timers, bad posture angles, etc. The values used in the demo are illustrative.

## Technology Used

The **Junction-2023-Huawei** website utilizes the following technology:

- **Webgazer:** Used for face tracking.
